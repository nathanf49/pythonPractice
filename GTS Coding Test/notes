To run the program, simply input the name of the file you wish to analyze.
I ran into issues when changing the input file from a variable or the input function to a command line input, so I have left the input function as I am running out of time for the test. 
The CSV, tempfile, shutil, and statistics libraries are required for this script, however they should all be included in an updated version of python3
I have generally assumed that no one would attempt to input the wrong data types or inputs to break the script, however I have still included based input and variable checking.
